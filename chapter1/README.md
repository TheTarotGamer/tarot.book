## Chapter 1 Intro
What is the Tarot? It is a deck of cards often consisting of 78
individual pieces that can be used for games, fortune telling, and
meditation. The Thoth Tarot deck often comes with 80 cards. It consists
of 78 traditional cards and an additional 2 magus cards. There does not
exist any one definitive deck and you could potentially run into many
different types of decks with many different numbers of cards included.

The majority of this book will be focused on the Thoth tarot deck. This
deck was the brainchild of the infamous magician Aleister Crowley. He
commissioned the art work for this deck through an artist, the Lady
Frieda Harris. She was a disciple of Aleister Crowley and also a member
of the Ordo Templi Orientis. She was versed in the I-Ching as her choice
of divination.

The pair worked tirelessly on the creation of the 80 paintings that
would eventually become the Thoth tarot deck. Harris and Crowley both
died before the cards could be published. They never saw the cards in
print.

Today we find Tarot cards nearly everywhere. You can find them in small stores
tucked away in the mall, online, or at your local big name book store. If you
decided to purchase a tarot card deck, you would be able to do so in short
order almost anywhere in the world.
